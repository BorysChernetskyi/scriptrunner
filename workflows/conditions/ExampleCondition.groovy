 * This is a Javadoc comment that provides documentation for the HashMap warning log message.
 *
 * The log entry indicates a warning generated by the ScriptBindingsManager, detailing the state of the internal
 * HashMap being used at that point in time. The HashMap contains workflow-related data from the OpenSymphony library,
 * including configuration, workflow entry, issue information, and steps. Below is a breakdown of the key elements.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY:</strong> The default initial capacity of the HashMap (16).</li>
 *   <li><strong>MAXIMUM_CAPACITY:</strong> The maximum capacity of the HashMap (1073741824).</li>
 *   <li><strong>DEFAULT_LOAD_FACTOR:</strong> The default load factor used for resizing (0.75).</li>
 *   <li><strong>TREEIFY_THRESHOLD:</strong> The threshold beyond which the HashMap will convert to a balanced tree (8).</li>
 *   <li><strong>UNTREEIFY_THRESHOLD:</strong> The threshold for converting from a tree back to a HashMap (6).</li>
 *   <li><strong>MIN_TREEIFY_CAPACITY:</strong> The minimum capacity for treeifying the structure (64).</li>
 *   <li><strong>table:</strong> The internal table structure holding the key-value pairs, with various elements including the workflow entry,
 *       configuration, and context.</li>
 *   <li><strong>entry:</strong> Represents the workflow entry, such as {@code com.opensymphony.workflow.spi.SimpleWorkflowEntry@1b0a3f0c}.</li>
 *   <li><strong>issue:</strong> The issue key associated with the workflow, represented as "IS-308".</li>
 *   <li><strong>configuration:</strong> Represents the workflow configuration, such as {@code com.opensymphony.workflow.config.DefaultConfiguration@74b19aac}.</li>
 *   <li><strong>context:</strong> Represents the workflow context, such as {@code com.opensymphony.workflow.basic.BasicWorkflowContext@6f63b025}.</li>
 *   <li><strong>originalissueobject:</strong> Represents the original issue object, which is "IS-308".</li>
 *   <li><strong>actionId:</strong> The ID of the current action being performed (11).</li>
 *   <li><strong>currentSteps:</strong> The current steps being tracked in the workflow, represented by a list of {@code SimpleStep} objects.</li>
 *   <li><strong>pkey:</strong> The project key, represented as "IS".</li>
 *   <li><strong>store:</strong> Represents the workflow store, such as {@code com.opensymphony.workflow.spi.ofbiz.OfbizWorkflowStore@408904d3}.</li>
 *   <li><strong>descriptor:</strong> Represents the workflow descriptor, such as {@code com.atlassian.jira.workflow.ImmutableWorkflowDescriptor@62d0eef4}.</li>
 *   <li><strong>size:</strong> The number of elements in the HashMap (10).</li>
 *   <li><strong>modCount:</strong> The number of modifications made to the HashMap (10).</li>
 *   <li><strong>threshold:</strong> The threshold at which resizing occurs (12).</li>
 *   <li><strong>loadFactor:</strong> The load factor used for resizing (0.75).</li>
 *   <li><strong>class:</strong> The class of the HashMap, which is {@code java.util.HashMap}.</li>
 *   <li><strong>empty:</strong> Indicates whether the HashMap is empty (false).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * This log message can be useful for debugging issues related to workflow bindings and tracking modifications
 * within the workflow state.
